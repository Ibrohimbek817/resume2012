        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>Grand Theft Auto IV is an open-world action-adventure game set in Liberty City, a fictional version of New York City. The game features a detailed urban environment, realistic mechanics, and a gripping storyline that follows Niko Bellic, an Eastern European war veteran who arrives in America seeking a fresh start but soon gets caught up in the criminal underworld.

            The gameplay in GTA IV revolves around an open-world exploration, mission-based progression, combat mechanics, vehicle driving, and various side activities.
            
            The open-world environment allows players to explore Liberty City freely. The city is divided into different boroughs, each inspired by real-life New York districts. Players can engage in various activities such as driving taxis, playing mini-games like bowling and darts, or even watching in-game television shows. The city feels alive with pedestrians, police, and dynamic weather changes. The wanted level system dictates police response; committing crimes increases the wanted level from 1 to 6 stars, with higher levels leading to stronger law enforcement pursuit.
            
            The game follows a mission-based structure, where Niko completes various tasks for different characters. Missions involve a mix of driving, gunfights, heists, and decision-making. Some missions present moral choices, where the player must decide the fate of certain characters, affecting the storyline. These choices add depth to the narrative and influence later interactions in the game.</p>
